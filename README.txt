I have created a simple javafx GUI application that challenges you to beat it at tic tac toe. It is impossible to beat it, however, you can of course try to beat it. It uses
the minimax algorithm to find ideal place to play its moves, ensuring it plays a perfect game. You can draw against it, lose against it, but not win.

This package contains the source code for the application. This package has the four class files for the application, an image called background.jpg, which the background
image displayed in the game, and a small css file tictactoe.css for some basic styling. The Main class is GameHandler.
